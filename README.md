# SUS helper~~s~~
## List of available tools : 
- A stacked bar chart creator
   - Generates a `.pgf` file that can be rendered within Latex, therefore keeping the same font as the document

That's it. Guess I'll add other helpers if I need them. 

## How to generate the graph
1. Add your questionnaires results within the .csv file. 
2. Run the script and enjoy the `output.pgf` graph.
